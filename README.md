# Imputation benchmarks
To run simulation study, run: 
* sim_logreg_nrmse.R - NRMSE simulation (difference to fully observed data)
* sim_logreg_pred.R - Prediction simulation (Logistic regression on imputed data)
* sim_logreg_coverage.R - Coverage simulation (Confidence interval coverage of GLM coefficients)
